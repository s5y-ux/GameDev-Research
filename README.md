## Purpose of this repository
This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress as I develop a third-person game using the Unity editor. The current version of the project features a player character that can move through a game environment while avoiding zombies, creating an engaging and dynamic gameplay experience. The core mechanics are built around Unityâ€™s transform system for movement, animation controllers for character animations, and colliders to manage interactions between game objects. The use of these components ensures smooth gameplay and realistic character movements.

The player and zombie models are sourced from Mixamo, offering high-quality animations and character designs that fit seamlessly into the game. With these assets, I've focused on implementing basic gameplay elements such as player navigation and zombie behavior. The zombies are programmed to pursue or react to the player, adding a layer of challenge and excitement to the game. The integration of animation controllers enhances the visual appeal, providing fluid transitions between different states and actions.

Looking ahead, I plan to expand the game by adding a shopkeeper character, which will introduce new gameplay features such as in-game purchases or upgrades. This addition will further enrich the player experience and open up new possibilities for interaction within the game world. As development continues, I will be refining the AI, improving level design, and incorporating additional assets to enhance the overall gameplay experience. This repository will continue to serve as a record of these advancements and a platform for future updates and improvements.
